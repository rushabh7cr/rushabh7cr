### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! I am Rushabh shah, pursuing masters in data science at the Indiana university Bloomington. My courses are inclined towards machine learning, statistics and deep learning. I have a background in computer science and software.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Lots of stuff!!
1. I am working on ELECTRA(NLP) model. It is a transformer based neural network used for various NLP tasks.
2. Graphical Neural Networks : This is less of an implementation and more of learning.
3. I am a graduate assistant. I teach and assist grad and PhD students in machine learning.
